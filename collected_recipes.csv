Best-ever Brussels sprouts,"['800 g Brussels sprouts ', '2  higher-welfare Cumberland sausages ', '½ a bunch of fresh sage (15g)', '20 g unsalted butter ', '1  onion ', '1  sweet eating apple ', '1  tablespoon Worcestershire sauce ']","1. Trim the Brussels and peel away any tatty outer leaves, halving any larger ones and keeping the smaller ones whole. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water for 5 minutes, then drain and leave to steam dry. 
2. Melt the butter in a large frying pan on a medium-low heat. Pick and add half the sage leaves, cook for 3 minutes, or until crispy, then tip into a small bowl. 
3. Place the pan back on the heat and squeeze the sausage meat from the skins directly into the pan, breaking it up with the back of a spoon. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until golden and crispy, while you peel and finely slice the onion, and pick and finely chop the remaining sage.
4. Add the onion and chopped sage to the pan and cook for 5 minutes on a medium-high heat, or until the onions have softened, stirring occasionally. 
5. Peel and core the apple, then finely dice. Tip into the pan, and add the sprouts too, then add the Worcestershire sauce and toss until hot through. 
6. Transfer to a serving platter, scatter over the crispy sage leaves, and dig in! 

Tip: For a veggie-friendly version, swap the sausages for chopped chestnuts, and use anchovy-free Worcestershire sauce."
Beautiful courgette carbonara,"['6 medium green and yellow courgettes ', '500 g penne ', '4 large free-range eggs ', '100 ml single cream ', '1 small handful of Parmesan cheese ', '  olive oil ', '6 slices of higher-welfare back bacon ', '½ a bunch of fresh thyme (15g)', 'a few  courgette flowers (optional)']","<ol class=""recipeSteps""><li>Put a large pan of salted water on to boil.</li><li>Halve and then quarter any larger courgettes lengthways. Cut out and discard any fluffy middle bits, and slice the courgettes at an angle into pieces roughly the same size and shape as the penne. Smaller courgettes can simply be sliced finely.</li><li>Your water will now be boiling, so add the penne to the pan and cook according to the packet instructions.</li><li>To make your creamy carbonara sauce, separate the eggs and put the yolks into a bowl (saving the whites for another recipe). Add the cream and grate in half the Parmesan, and mix together with a fork. Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side.</li><li>Heat a very large frying pan (a 35cm one is a good start – every house should have one!) and add a good splash of olive oil. Cut the pancetta or bacon into chunky lardons and fry until dark brown and crisp.</li><li>Add the courgette slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper, not just to season but to give it a bit of a kick. Pick, chop and sprinkle in the thyme leaves (reserving any flowers), give everything a stir, so the courgettes become coated with all the lovely bacon-flavoured oil, and fry until they start to turn lightly golden and have softened slightly.</li><li>It’s very important to get this next bit right or your carbonara could end up ruined. You need to work quickly. When the pasta is cooked, drain it, reserving a little of the cooking water. Immediately, toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes, bacon and lovely flavours, then remove from the heat and add a ladleful of the reserved cooking water and your creamy sauce. Stir together quickly. (No more cooking now, otherwise you’ll scramble the eggs.)</li><li>Get everyone around the table, ready to eat straight away. While you’re tossing the pasta and sauce, grate in the rest of the Parmesan and add a little more of the cooking water if needed, to give you a silky and shiny sauce. Taste quickly for seasoning.</li><li>If you’ve managed to get any courgette flowers, tear them over the top, then serve and eat immediately, as the sauce can become thick and stodgy if left too long.</li></ol>"

Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.</li><li>When the time’s up, sprinkle the breadcrumbs on to a tray.

Place in a bowl, finely grate in the lemon zest, squeeze in the juice and add a good pinch of salt. Deseed and finely slice the chilli and add to the bowl, then mix up.</li><li>Just under half fill a large sturdy pan with vegetable oil – the oil should be 8cm deep, but never fill your pan more than half full – and place on a medium-high heat. Use a thermometer to tell when it’s ready (170°C), or add a piece of potato and wait until it turns golden – that’s the sign that it’s ready to go.</li><li>Carefully lower the chicken into the oil, fry for 8 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, then drain on kitchen paper. </li><li>Alternatively, drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large, cold non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Cook the chicken for 10 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning after 6 minutes and drizzling with an extra 2 tablespoons of oil as you turn.</li><li>To serve, put a quarter of the rice into a small bowl, press to compact and turn out on to a plate, then repeat with the other portions.
